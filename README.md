[How to use Github / How to submit](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CS-5500/#/labs?id=github-classroom)

For this lab, you will include all of your "answers" in this README file. Make sure to cite any sources you use. 

Reminder, this is the syntax to include an image in a markdown (`.md`) file:
```markdown
![](path/to/file/image.png)

Example - if a file called test.png was located in this folder:
![alt-text](test.png)
```

## Task 0: Declare your AI Usage

After you completed this lab, make sure to submit the AI declaration form via MS Form and also upload a PDF copy of your responses to this repository and include the link to PDF in this README file. Note, you must submit this form regardless if you use AI or not. Failure to submit this form will be considered a violation of AI course policy. More details about the AI-usage course policy can be found [here](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CS-5500/#/ai-policy).

[Link to AI Usage Disclosure MS Form](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CS-5500/#/ai-policy?id=disclosure-of-ai-use)

- You will need to log in with your SFU email to access the form. If you're unsuccessful, try using a different browser or incognito mode. Clearing your cache and cookies may also help.

Name the file in the following format: 

`L#_AI_Declaration_FirstName_LastName_StudentID.pdf`

Example (Lab 3):

`L3_AI_Declaration_Parsa_Rajabi_123456789.pdf`

## Task 3: Lab Questions (11 marks)

Include answers as described in the [Lab 1](L1.md) file:

### Q1 
Git is a distributed version control system, and designed for programmer teamwork. Git is focused on code sharing and changes tracking. Git is a software.
         
Github is a web-based Git repository hosting services. Github is focused on centralized source code hosting. Github has a built-in user management feature. GitHub is a service.

### Q2
1. Every single developer or client has their own server and they will have a copy of the entire history or version of the code and all of its branches in their local server or machine. Therefore, every client or user can work locally and disconnnected. 

2. When client or user need to use the code, they can clone the entire history or copy of the code without relying on the central server. After they make their changes, they can push their change sets to the master repository or pull new change.

### Q3
1. Modified Stage: When developers want to improve a project, they create a local copy (remote repository) on their computer. This lets them modify code without affecting the original project - like having your own workspace to experiment safely.
   
2. Staged Stage: After making changes, we use 'git add' to move files to a preparation area (staging area). Think of it like a checkpoint before finalizing changes. It's similar to runners in a race at the "Set" position - everything is ready but waiting for the final signal.
   
3. Commit Stage: This is the "Go" moment where changes become permanent. When you commit, you're saving your modifications to your local repository with a timestamp and your details. Each commit is like a snapshot of your project at that specific moment, documenting who made what changes and when.

### Q4

#### Q4 (i)
Downloads a complete copy of a remote repository to your local machine
#### Q4 (ii)
Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked in your working directory
#### Q4 (iii)
Downloads updates from remote repository without merging them into your working files
#### Q4 (iv)
Creates a new Git repository by initializing the .git directory
#### Q4 (v)
Shows commit history with details like messages, authors, and timestamps
### Q5
A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. 

Used to exclude temporary files, build outputs, and sensitive data from version control.
## Task 4: Video Questions (4 marks)

Include answers as described in the [Lab 1](L1.md) file.

### Q1
This video introduces the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which consists of seven key phases: planning, requirements analysis, design, implementation/coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The process begins with the customer presenting a business idea to the product owner, followed by detailed planning and requirements analysis by the entire team, including developers, testers, and operations staff. During the implementation and testing phase, developers write code and testers create test cases and identify bugs to ensure that the application works properly before deployment. After deployment to production servers, the maintenance phase includes monitoring system performance, resolving user issues, and implementing new features through iterative SDLC cycles.

### Q2

The software development lifecycle is critical because it provides a systematic framework to effectively manage complex projects. Dividing the complex development to seven phases, teams can better organize their workflow and monitor progress. This structured approach helps identify potential problems early, reduces costly fixes later in the process, and ensures that the final product meets quality standards. In addition, the SDLC facilitates effective collaboration among international team members by providing clear guidance and expectations during each development phase.
